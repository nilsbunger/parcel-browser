            <p className="py-6">Local development team <b>Backyard</b> is building 19 "missing middle" residential units across three lots in San Diego's hip North Park and Normal Heights neighborhoods. The project is underwritten to a 6.3% UYOC and investor IRR of 16% to 18%, with an exit timeline of 6 to 10 years. <b>Home3</b> secured a $1M equity allocation, exclusively offered to our network of investors.</p>

          <h1>Why we like this deal</h1>          
          <ul>
              <li><strong>Location, x3</strong>. The sites are well positioned in and around North Park, one of the strongest submarkets in San Diego. The city has a diverse economy and has arguably the strongest post-pandemic recovery in the country.</li>
              <li><strong>Promising team.&nbsp;</strong>Roee, Coby and Gabe amassed considerable real estate experience working with their families and professional firms, have a deep understanding of their market and target tenants, and are in a city that&apos;s hungry for their style of development. They are strongly committed to rewarding their investors as a necessary ingredient to continue their career growth.</li>
              <li><strong>Margin of safety.&nbsp;</strong>The project is utilizing reasonable leverage (64% LTV), the GPs have skin in the game (family equity is ~10% of total project cost), and secured construction financing for 2 of 3 projects at low rates (8%). All three project sites were acquired before a recent 28% increase in prices, and they are being developed sequentially, creating the option to hold or sell the last site if appropriate. These items provides an exit path in case of a bear-case scenario.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>We encourage all investors to perform their own dilligence. As always, Real Estate investments are inherently risky and can go to zero due to a variety of factors within and outside the GP's control.</p>
          <h1>Locations</h1>
          <p>The sites are short walks to vibrant commercial corridors and frequent transit, sub-15 minutes drive to downtown San Diego, and sub-30 minutes drive to <a target="blank" href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/22/07/27/apple-buys-new-campus-for-445-million-for-vast-san-diego-expansion">Apple‚Äôs planned 5,000 employee Rancho Bernardo engineering campus</a>. Backyard chose the sites because they‚Äôre in walkable neighborhoods close to desirable amenities like restaurants, cafes, parks, boutique shops, and cultural institutions. These locations command a higher premium because demand to live in walkable, mixed-use neighborhoods considerably outpaces supply.</p>
          <img src="/images/SD_property_map.jpeg"/>
          <p>The project benefits from <a href='https://www.zumper.com/rent-research/san-diego-ca/north-park'>17% annual rent growth</a> in its submarket, drawing on San Diego‚Äôs <a  href='https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/politics/story/2023-02-10/san-diego-tax-revenue-fully-recovered-from-pandemic-plunge'>nation-leading pandemic recovery</a></p>
          <p>The New York Times <a target='_blank' href='https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/03/09/realestate/san-diego-houses-homes.html'>just recognized</a> North Park as "one of San Diego‚Äôs trendiest neighborhoods". They called Normal Heights, which is adjacent to the east, "a colorful, walkable neighborhood with craft-beer pubs, pizzerias and vegetarian restaurants". Both neighborhoods are emerging as prime destinations for urban-minded professionals. Their ecletic, upscale vibe and proximity to a major park reminds us of Dolores Heights in San Francisco.</p>
          <h2>Development Plan</h2>          
          <p>
          The three sites are in process of being developed into 3-12 units each, through value add improvements and/or ground up development. The design philosophy caters to high-end renters, with thoughtful touches like balconies, floor-to-ceiling windows, and quality finishes.

          <p>Home3 secured a $1M allocation as primary LP, to be invested via a Special Purpose Vehicle (the "SPV"). We are charging a 1.5% AUM fee to cover our legal and accounting costs. As a volume investor discount, we secured a 0.25% (TODO:VERIFY) discount on Backyard's waterfall via a side letter. The SPV has its own waterfall, which represents Home3's upside.</p>
